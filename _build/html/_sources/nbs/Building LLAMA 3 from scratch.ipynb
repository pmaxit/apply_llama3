    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Tokenization**: The model breaks down text into smaller units called tokens (words, punctuation, etc.).\n",
    "- **Pattern Recognition**: It learns the relationships between these tokens, understanding which words are likely to follow others.\n",
    "- **Prediction**: Given a sequence of words, it calculates the probability of different words coming next and chooses the most likely one.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Different Flavors of Language Models:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **N-gram Models**: These simpler models look at a fixed number of previous words (bigrams consider two, trigrams consider three) to predict the next.\n",
    "2. **Neural Network Models**: These more sophisticated models use artificial neural networks to capture complex patterns in language.\n",
    "3. **Transformer Models**: The latest breakthrough, these models use attention mechanisms to weigh the importance of different words in a sequence, leading to remarkable performance."
